Next verification: Memory handling + persona-building accuracy.

I want to confirm how memories and persona modeling are currently implemented.

1. Memory Extraction
From the onboarding wizard:
- Which specific fields are treated as "memories"?
- Where in the code does memory extraction happen?
- Are memories stored as a list, a single text blob, or both?

2. Persona Creation Details
When onboarding completes:
- What data is currently used to construct the persona’s long-term identity?
- Does the persona object store:
    - personality traits?
    - communication style?
    - humor details?
    - memories from Step 7?
    - unresolved conversations from Step 8?
- Please list each field and where it is stored (which part of persona).

3. Memory Storage Location
Please confirm:
- Where are memories stored? (e.g., persona.memories, persona.notes, onboarding_context.memories, etc.)
- What is the shape of the data structure?
- Are memories retrievable and used during conversations?

4. How AI Uses Memories in Conversations
For ongoing conversation messages (NOT first message):
- Does the prompt send memories to the AI?
- If so, how many?
- In what format?
- Is there a mechanism to:
    - summarize them?
    - compress them?
    - limit the number sent for token efficiency?

5. Memory Retrieval Logic
Please confirm the logic for retrieving memories:
- Is it always the full array?
- Is it selecting “recent” memories?
- Is it selecting by relevance?
- Is it selecting based on emotional content?
- Or is it simple: “send everything every time”?

6. Updating or Expanding Memories
When users add more memories later (outside onboarding):
- Where does this feature currently live?
- Does the current version allow adding new memories at all?
- If yes, where are they stored and how do they affect persona behavior?
- If no, just confirm it’s not implemented.

7. Missing or Deviations
Please list any gaps between the current memory-handling system and the ideal version described in the artifact (e.g., future memory gallery, guided memory prompts, curated persona evolution, etc.).

No code changes yet — just confirm current implementation.

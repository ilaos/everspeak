# Design Guidelines Not Applicable

**Project Type:** Backend API (Node.js + Express)

This project is a **backend-only API service** with no frontend user interface component. The "Everspeak Backend" consists of:

- Express server endpoints
- API routes
- Controllers and utilities
- Server configuration

**No visual design guidelines are needed** because there is no user-facing interface to design.

## If You Need Frontend Design Guidelines

If you plan to create a frontend application that consumes this API, please specify:

1. **Application Type** (e.g., web app, dashboard, marketing site)
2. **Primary Purpose** (e.g., language learning, communication platform, content management)
3. **Key Features** (e.g., user authentication, real-time chat, content display)
4. **Target Audience** (e.g., students, professionals, general public)
5. **Any Aesthetic Preferences** (e.g., modern, minimal, playful)

Once you provide frontend requirements, I'll create comprehensive design guidelines including:
- Visual design approach
- Component specifications
- Layout patterns
- Typography system
- Spacing conventions
- User experience patterns

**Current Status:** Backend API only - no design guidelines required.

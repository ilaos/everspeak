Next verification: Onboarding wizard state, navigation, and resume behavior.

I want to understand how resilient and forgiving the onboarding wizard is.

1. Wizard State Persistence
- If the user closes the wizard mid-way (e.g., hits X, reloads the page, or navigates away):
  - Does the wizard progress (current step + answers so far) get saved anywhere?
  - On returning, does the user see a "resume where you left off" experience?
  - Or does the wizard always restart at Step 1?

- Please confirm:
  - Where (if anywhere) wizard state is stored (frontend state only, localStorage, backend, etc.)
  - What happens after a full browser refresh during onboarding.

2. Persona Creation Timing
- At what point is the persona actually created?
  - Before the wizard starts (placeholder persona)?
  - After the wizard completes?
- If a persona is created BEFORE wizard completion:
  - What happens if the user abandons onboarding?
  - Do we end up with partially-configured personas in the list?
  - Is there any cleanup logic for incomplete personas?

3. "Continue Setup" Behavior
- When a persona is in an incomplete state:
  - How does the "Continue Setup" button know which step to resume at?
  - Does it:
    - Always start back at Step 1?
    - Use any stored progress to jump back to the last answered step?
- Please describe the exact logic used to determine the resume step.

4. Edge Cases
Please confirm current behavior for these situations:
  - User clicks "Need more time" in Step Zero, closes the app, and returns later.
  - User starts onboarding, answers up to Step 5, then refreshes the page.
  - User completes onboarding, then reopens the wizard via some UI — what do they see?

5. Deviations from Ideal UX
Compared to an ideal grief-aware onboarding experience that:
  - Allows resuming mid-way without losing answers
  - Avoids cluttering the persona list with half-finished entries
  - Treats onboarding as a meaningful ritual, not something to restart repeatedly

Please list:
  - Anything that is currently rough, incomplete, or could feel "jarring" to the user.

No code changes yet — just describe current behavior and limitations.

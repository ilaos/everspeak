I want to deploy my Everspeak application using Replit Deployments. 
Please perform the following steps carefully and in this order:

-------------------------
A. PREPARE FOR DEPLOYMENT
-------------------------

1. Verify that my application already runs locally when I press “Run.”
   - It should start the Express server on port 5000.
   - It should serve the frontend from public/.
   - If needed, ensure that Express uses:
       app.use(express.static('public'));
       app.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000);
   - Confirm nothing in the code uses a hardcoded localhost:5000 URL; use relative URLs ("/api/...") instead.

2. Create a new file in the root directory:
   replit.nix
   If one exists, review it but do NOT remove required dependencies.

   Ensure the Nix environment includes:
   - nodejs
   - npm
   - any other required packages your system already uses

3. Ensure no hardcoded ports besides process.env.PORT || 5000.

-------------------------
B. CREATE A DEPLOYMENT TARGET
-------------------------

1. Use Replit Deployments (the “Deploy” tab).
2. Create a new Deployment with the following settings:

   TYPE: Web Server
   ENTRY POINT: server/index.ts OR server/index.js (whichever my project uses)
   INSTALL COMMAND: npm install
   BUILD COMMAND: (leave blank unless required)
   RUN COMMAND: npm start  (or: node server/index.js — whichever matches my existing setup)

3. IMPORTANT:
   Configure the Deployment Environment Variables:
   - OPENAI_API_KEY = <value already stored in Replit Secrets>
   - Any other secrets already used in this project

4. Set the Deployment Auto-Restart to ON.
5. Set Deployment Visibility to PUBLIC.
6. Enable HTTPS (Replit does this by default).

-------------------------
C. CORS & SECURITY HARDENING
-------------------------

Before deploying, update CORS settings in the Express server:

- Allow only the deployed Replit URL AND localhost for development.
- Example:
    const allowed = [
      "http://localhost:5000",
      "https://<YOUR-REPLIT-DEPLOYMENT-URL>"
    ];

    const corsOptions = {
      origin: function(origin, callback) {
        if (!origin || allowed.includes(origin)) callback(null, true);
        else callback(new Error("CORS blocked"));
      }
    };

    app.use(cors(corsOptions));

Add basic rate limiting:
   const rateLimit = require("express-rate-limit");
   const limiter = rateLimit({
     windowMs: 60 * 1000,
     max: 30,
   });
   app.use(limiter);

-------------------------
D. DEPLOY IT
-------------------------

Once the above is ready:

1. Press "Deploy".
2. Wait for the build and startup logs.
3. When it finishes successfully:
   - Provide me the LIVE PUBLIC URL.

-------------------------
E. FINAL CHECK
-------------------------

After deployment:

1. Open the public URL in your browser.
2. Then open it on your mobile phone.
3. Verify:
   - Persona dropdown loads
   - Memories load
   - Chat works with AI
   - Wizard works
   - Journaling works
   - Voice transcription works (mobile mic support)
   - Booster modal works

If anything fails, tell me the error logs, and I will fix it.

-------------------------

Please proceed with the deployment now.

**Please add a simple web UI to the existing Everspeak backend so I can interact with personas and the /api/message endpoint without touching code.

Requirements:

Static Frontend Setup

Create a public/ folder with:

public/index.html

public/styles.css

public/app.js

In the Express server (entry file), add static serving:

app.use(express.static('public'));

Root URL / should serve index.html.

Page Layout (index.html)
Design a clean, simple single-page layout with three main sections:

A) Persona Panel (left/top on mobile)

A dropdown to select an existing persona

A list showing basic info of the selected persona:

name

relationship

description

A "Create New Persona" form with fields:

Name (required)

Relationship (optional)

Description (optional)

A "Save Persona" button that calls:

POST /api/personas for new

PUT /api/personas/:id for updates (only if editing mode is added)

B) Memory Panel (middle)

Shows a list of memories for the selected persona:

category

text

weight

A form to add a new memory with fields:

Category (dropdown with:
humor, regrets, childhood, advice, personality, misc)

Memory text (required)

Weight (number, default 1.0)

A "Add Memory" button that calls:

POST /api/personas/:id/memories

Each memory entry should have a small "Delete" button:

Calls DELETE /api/personas/:id/memories/:memoryId

C) Chat Panel (right/bottom)

Shows a scrollable conversation area:

User messages aligned right

Persona (EverSpeak) messages aligned left

An input box for user message

A dropdown for:

Emotional State (e.g. neutral, sad, reflective, anxious, excited)

Tone Mode (e.g. auto, gentle, casual, real_talk)

A "Send" button that:

Calls POST /api/message with JSON:
{
"user_message": "...",
"emotional_state": "...",
"tone_mode": "...",
"persona_id": "<selected persona id>"
}

The reply should be rendered in the chat area as a new message from the persona.

Frontend Logic (app.js)
Implement the following behaviors using plain JavaScript (no frameworks):

On page load:

Fetch all personas from GET /api/personas

Populate the persona dropdown

Automatically select the first persona (if any), and:

Load its memories from GET /api/personas/:id/memories

Display them in the Memory Panel

When creating a new persona:

Submit form to POST /api/personas

On success:

Add new persona to dropdown

Select it

Clear memory list for that persona

When changing personas from the dropdown:

Load its memories via GET /api/personas/:id/memories

Update persona info section (name/relationship/description)

Clear the chat and start a fresh conversation context (UI only; backend already handles state per request)

When adding a memory:

POST to /api/personas/:id/memories

On success, append it to the memory list

When deleting a memory:

Call DELETE /api/personas/:id/memories/:memoryId

Remove it from the list in the UI

When sending a chat message:

If no persona is selected, show an alert asking to create or select one.

POST to /api/message with:

user_message (from input)

emotional_state (from dropdown)

tone_mode (from dropdown)

persona_id (from selected persona)

On success:

Append the user message to chat as “You”

Append the reply as persona’s name (e.g., "Jimmy")

Keep messages in chronological order

Styling (styles.css)

Use a simple, clean layout:

On desktop: three columns (persona, memories, chat)

On mobile: stacked vertically

Neutral, calm colors (light grays, soft blue accents)

Make chat area scrollable with a max height

Keep it basic but neat; this is a prototype, not final marketing UI.

Constraints / Consistency

Do NOT break existing API endpoints.

Do NOT change backend response structures.

Reuse the existing /api/message and /api/personas routes exactly as currently implemented.

Keep all JavaScript on the frontend in public/app.js.

Ensure CORS and static serving are configured so this UI works inside Replit’s web preview.

After implementing, please:

Confirm the key flows:

Create persona → Add memories → Send message → Get AI reply

Ensure the app loads at / in the browser.

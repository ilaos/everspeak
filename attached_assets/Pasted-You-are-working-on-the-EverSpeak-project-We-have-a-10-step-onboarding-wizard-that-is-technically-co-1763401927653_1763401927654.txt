You are working on the EverSpeak project.
We have a 10-step onboarding wizard that is technically correct but feels like a cold form. We want it to feel like a warm grief counselor guiding the user.

Important constraints:

Do not change the structure of the wizard payloads (wizard_inputs) or the backend API contract.

Keep the same steps and fields currently sent to /api/personas/:id/wizard.

Step Zero (emotional prep modal) is already implemented and approved. Do not change its logic, only minor wording if absolutely needed.

Focus on: tone, copy, micro-acknowledgments, and emotional pacing inside the wizard.

We want this to feel like a therapist / grief counselor, not like a survey.

1. Files to Work In

Frontend: public/index.html, public/app.js, and any CSS where wizard UI text / labels / headings / helper copy live.

Do not change backend files or payload structure for this task, unless it’s purely for text constants in a shared config.

You already verified the current wizard steps:

Personality Snapshot

How They Communicated

Their Humor

When Did They Pass?

What Was Your Relationship Like Near the End?

If You're Comfortable Sharing… (Circumstances – optional)

Memories That Matter

Unfinished Conversations

Tone Preferences (sliders)

“Thank You for Sharing / Ready to Begin?” screen

Keep this structure and ordering. We are only making it feel like the therapist-style flow below.

2. New Therapist-Style Copy for Each Step

Update the headings, prompts, placeholders, and button labels for each step to match this tone. You can adjust line breaks as needed, but keep wording as close as possible.

STEP 1 – Personality Snapshot

Heading:
“Getting to Know Who They Were”

Intro text (static on the step):
“Before we go any further, I want to acknowledge something important:
you’re here because you lost someone who mattered deeply to you.
That takes courage. We’ll go through this slowly and gently.”

Prompt:
“When you think about who they were as a person, how would you describe their personality?”

Placeholder:
“Were they gentle, intense, steady, silly, serious, nurturing, reserved…? Anything that feels true.”

STEP 2 – How They Communicated

Acknowledgment shown at top when arriving on Step 2:
“Thank you for sharing that. It gives me a sense of who they were.”

Heading:
“How It Felt to Talk With Them”

Prompt:
“When you talked with them, what did it feel like?”

Placeholder:
“Did they listen quietly? Tease you? Get straight to the point? Wrap you in warmth? Something else?”

STEP 3 – Their Humor

Acknowledgment at top of Step 3:
“I hear you. That paints a more human picture of them.”

Heading:
“Their Humor (If Any)”

Prompt:
“Did they have a sense of humor? If so, what was it like?”

Placeholder:
“Dry, goofy, sarcastic, gentle, punny, dark, playful… or you can say they weren’t really the joking type.”

STEP 4 – When Did They Pass?

Acknowledgment at top of Step 4:
“Thank you. Those details matter, even if they’re hard to put into words.”

Heading:
“When You Lost Them”

Prompt:
“When did you lose them? It’s okay if you only remember the general time.”

Placeholder:
“For example: ‘Spring 2023’, ‘about two years ago’, or ‘November 15, 2021’.”

STEP 5 – Relationship Near the End

Acknowledgment at top of Step 5:
“I hear you. That time in your life can hold a lot.”

Heading:
“How Things Were Near the End”

Prompt:
“How were things between you near the end? There’s no right or wrong answer.”

Placeholder:
“Were you close? Was it complicated? Was it sudden, or a long illness? Were there things that never got said?”

STEP 6 – Circumstances (Optional / Skippable)

Acknowledgment at top of Step 6:
“Thank you for sharing that. We’ll keep moving gently.”

Heading:
“If You’re Comfortable Sharing…”

Prompt:
“If you feel okay sharing, how did they pass?
This is completely optional — you can skip it if it feels too heavy right now.”

Textarea placeholder:
“You can share as much or as little as you’d like. It’s also okay to leave this blank.”

Skip button label:
“I’m not ready to talk about this yet”

Skip behavior:

Keep the existing behavior: do not save a value, advance to the next step.

Keep the existing onboarding_context behavior as-is (no new fields, no change in payload structure).

STEP 7 – Memories That Matter

Acknowledgment at top of Step 7:
“Thank you. That tells me a lot about the emotional space you’re coming from.”

Heading:
“Memories That Stay With You”

Prompt:
“Tell me about a few moments you think of often. They don’t need to be big or dramatic — just real.”

Placeholder:
“Everyday routines, little rituals, big days, private jokes… anything that still feels vivid.”

STEP 8 – Unfinished Conversations

Acknowledgment at top of Step 8:
“Those memories are important. Thank you for trusting me with them.”

Heading:
“Things Left Unsaid”

Prompt:
“Is there anything you wish you could have said to them, or heard from them?”

Placeholder:
“Regrets, apologies, reassurances, questions — anything you still find yourself carrying.”

STEP 9 – Tone Preferences (Sliders)

Acknowledgment at top of Step 9:
“Thank you. You’ve shared a lot already, and you’re doing more work than it might seem.”

Heading:
“How You’d Like Them to Sound Here”

Prompt (above sliders):
“Now we’ll set how you’d like them to show up in these conversations.
There are no perfect settings — just choose what feels most supportive for you right now.”

Update helper text around sliders to feel more therapeutic, for example:

Humor: “How much lightness or playfulness feels okay for you?”

Honesty: “Do you want them to be very gentle, or more direct?”

Sentimentality: “How emotional or tender do you want the tone to be?”

Energy: “Do you prefer a calm, steady presence or more enthusiasm?”

Advice: “Do you want a lot of advice, or mostly listening and reflecting?”

Keep the actual slider values and backend fields exactly as they are.

STEP 10 – Final Transition Screen

Heading:
“Thank You for Sharing All of That”

Body copy (replace current copy with this style):
“I know none of this is easy to talk about.
Everything you’ve shared will be held carefully and used to shape how they ‘sound’ here — drawn only from your memories, never pretending to be more than that.”

“We’ll use this to:”

“shape a gentle first message in their voice,”

“honor the way you described their personality and presence,”

“respect the boundaries and tone that feel safest for you right now.”

Question:
“Would you like to begin your first conversation now, or take a moment before we continue?”

Buttons:

Primary: “Begin our first conversation”

Secondary: “Give me a moment”

Keep all existing behavior wired as-is:

“Begin our first conversation” submits to /api/personas/:id/wizard, closes the wizard, scrolls to the Conversation Room, shows the pre-roll, and sends the first message with is_first_message: true.

“Give me a moment” keeps the persona, closes the wizard, sets the existing “waiting” flag, and shows whatever banner you currently have.

3. Add Per-Step Acknowledgments (Micro-Responses)

Right now, when the user clicks “Next,” the wizard jumps immediately to the next step with no emotional acknowledgment.

Add a simple per-step acknowledgment block at the top of each step (under the step heading) that:

Shows a short, static sentence that reflects what they just did in the previous step.

Does not require dynamic personalization for now (no need to inject their actual text).

Only appears after step 1 (since step 1 itself is the starting point).

Implementation suggestion:

In app.js, where you manage wizardCurrentStep and updateWizardUI(), introduce a small map like:

const wizardAcknowledgments = {
  2: "Thank you for sharing that. It gives me a sense of who they were.",
  3: "I hear you. That paints a more human picture of them.",
  4: "Thank you. Those details matter, even if they’re hard to put into words.",
  5: "I hear you. That time in your life can hold a lot.",
  6: "Thank you for sharing that. We’ll keep moving gently.",
  7: "Thank you. That tells me a lot about the emotional space you’re coming from.",
  8: "Those memories are important. Thank you for trusting me with them.",
  9: "Thank you. You’ve shared a lot already, and you’re doing more work than it might seem.",
  10: "Everything you’ve shared so far will be held carefully here."
};


In updateWizardUI(), when rendering a step, check wizardAcknowledgments[wizardCurrentStep] and, if present, show it in a small, soft-styled paragraph under the heading.

Styling guidance:

Make the acknowledgment text slightly softer-looking than the main prompt:

Smaller font-size or lighter weight

Maybe italic or a subtle muted color

No animations are required for now; simple fade-in via CSS is fine if easy.

4. Acceptance Criteria

Please implement the above and then verify:

All wizard steps still submit the same wizard_inputs structure as before to /api/personas/:id/wizard. No field additions, renames, or removals.

Step 6 skip behavior still works exactly as before, with the new compassionate labels.

After each step, the next step shows a brief acknowledgment line at the top, matching the copy above.

The user experience feels like a gentle, grief-aware guided conversation, not a dry form:

No abrupt jumps with zero acknowledgment.

All language is warm, non-clinical, and non-patronizing.

Step Zero remains the same structurally, and the Step 10 “Begin our first conversation / Give me a moment” behavior is unchanged.

When you’re done, summarize:

Which files you changed

Any places where you had to slightly adapt the wording

Confirmation that no backend contracts were altered

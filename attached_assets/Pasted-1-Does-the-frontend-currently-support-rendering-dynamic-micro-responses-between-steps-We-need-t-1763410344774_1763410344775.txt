1. Does the frontend currently support rendering dynamic “micro-responses” between steps?

We need to know:

Can you show an acknowledgment before moving to the next step?

Or does the wizard move immediately by design?

This determines whether:

We add a pacing delay,

Or we restructure the wizard UI to allow for acknowledgment messages.

📌 Without this, we don’t know if our conversational onboarding style is compatible with the current UI architecture.

2. Can the wizard support a 2-phase pattern per step?

Example:

Phase A — Acknowledge
Phase B — Ask next question

This is critical, because our conversational flow depends on it.

Ask:

Does the wizard architecture allow sub-states per step?

Or do we need to redesign the component?

3. What mechanism is used for step transitions?

We need to know:

Are steps controlled by a currentStep index?

Is it a router-based step flow?

Or a state machine?

This affects how we introduce pacing, micro-responses, and emotional transitions.

4. Can the user’s typed response be intercepted BEFORE moving to the next step?

Ask Replit:

When the user presses “Next,” can we run logic before changing steps?

We need this for:

showing the acknowledgment,

adding natural delays,

triggering animation or fade,

and then moving on.

5. Is the wizard currently able to hold local draft state per step (before saving)?

We need clarity on:

Where responses are stored (component state? global store? memory?)

Whether we can save partial drafts after each step

Whether the system supports “resume from last step” logic

We need this info before we design the persistence behavior.

6. Does the codebase have a central place to insert pacing/timing logic (delays, fade transitions)?

For example:

A central UI layer that handles “typing” simulation

Or individual step components we’ll need to modify

We need to know whether pacing is controlled:

Globally

Or at the level of each step

7. How did Replit envision tone preferences (Step 9)?

We need to know:

Is Step 9 coded as sliders inside a settings component?

Or as a regular step in the onboarding wizard?

This determines how we reframe it conversationally without breaking UI.

8. Does the codebase already support mid-wizard data persistence?

Replit needs to confirm explicitly:

Do we have any technical hook for partial saves?

Or do we need to create a draft persona object?

Or do we need to write new backend endpoints?

This is essential.

9. Can we add “emotional transitions” between questions?

Ask whether the frontend can:

fade out the question,

show acknowledgment,

fade in the next question.

Or:

if it requires new components,

or if the current flow is too rigid.
